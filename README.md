- Clone the repository
- Open the folder with your IDE
- Get the dependencies with `npm install` 
  - not sure how to use npm? Read [this](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
- Read the [Leaderboard API documentation](https://www.notion.so/microverse/Leaderboard-API-service-24c0c3c116974ac49488d4eb0267ade3) to learn how to use this API.
- Create a new game with the name of your choice by using the API. You cab uncomment the line 11 in the `src/index.js` file to create a new game.
- Make sure that you saved the ID of your game that will be returned by API. You will need it to submit your scores.
- Comment the line 11 in the `src/index.js` file so that you don't create a new game every time you refresh the page.
- Replace the ID of the game in the `modules/getScores.js` file on line 2 and in the `modules/addScores.js` file on line 8.
